I tried my best to fit the requirement, but I don't know how to connect Router2 and Router5, since there are only 2 serial ports in the PT-Router.

Differences:

(1) RIP is applied in small and medium scale network, while OSPF in large scale network. RIP is more simple than OSPF.

(2) In RIP, router will send its own routing table to other routers. OSPF will force all routers to exchange the routing information to form a routing database.

(3) RIP will cost more time and bandwidth than OSPF to reach the balance. OSPF will cost more memory than RIP.
